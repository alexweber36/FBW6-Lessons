## What Is a CSS Framework?
CSS frameworks provide a basic structure for designing consistent solutions to tackle common issues across front-end web development. They provide generic functionality which can be overridden for specific scenarios and applications. This greatly decreases the time needed to start creating applications and websites.
Web Developers used to spend a lot of time creating beautiful CSS. Thanks to the CSS frameworks, we now have a better, faster, and more effective way to build responsive websites and web applications.

## How do CSS frameworks work?
